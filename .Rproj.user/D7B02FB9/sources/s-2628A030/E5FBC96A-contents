Description: Provides the Logistic Vector Smooth Transition AutoRegression (LVSTAR) modelling in Teräsvirta and Yang (2014a) <ftp://ftp.econ.au.dk/creates/rp/14/rp14_04.pdf> and Teräsvirta and Yang (2014b) <ftp://ftp.econ.au.dk/creates/rp/14/rp14_08.pdf>.
    The modelling procedure consists of three stages: Specification, Estimation and Evaluation.
    The package offers tools helping the package user(s) to conduct model specification tests,
    to do LVSTAR model estimation, and to do model evaluation.
    The tests implemented in the package are heteroskedasticity-consistent.
    The wild bootstrap tests are also implemented.
    Parallel computation (as an option) is implemented in some functions, especially the bootstrap tests.
    The package suits tasks running many cores on super-computation servers.
